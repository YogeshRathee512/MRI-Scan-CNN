# MRI-Scan-CNN

Dataframe containing image , mask and image id as input and perform 2 type of prediction on the image
Initially, image is passed through the classification network(ResNet) which predicts whether the image has defect or not, the model
predicts 98% accuracy that the image has defect or not (defect means tumor) , if the model labels the images as defect it passes the image to the
segmentation network (U-net build from scratch) then the  location of defect is found.

leveraging transfer learning with resunet architecture which was original trainned on imagenet dataset(1 million images) and 1000 classes we remove the head and add custom head for binary classification
